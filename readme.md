# Library Time

This is a little vanilla JavaScript project for creating timetables.

It's called LibraryTime because my wife works in a library and makes her timetables in Excel. Now, I'd never dream of assuming I can do better (Excel, after all, does run the world), but it seemed like a nice constrained domain to play with.

This project is intentionally very small and intentionally very rough. It is a project for me to work on when I want to relax, when I just want to write a bit of code, when I want to work on something for which there are no expectations.

## Goals

- Learn how to use FullCalendar
- Don't use any frameworks or bundlers
- All data is stored locally
